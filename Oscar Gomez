Below is your direct deposit enrollment information. Give this information to your employer or benefits provider to enroll in ASAP Direct Deposit, and you could get paid up to 2 days earlier or your government benefits up to 4 days earlier. As soon as we receive your money, we'll deposit it right away. Unlike most banks, we won't hold your money until payday.

Bank Routing Number: 124303120 
Bank Account Number: 302885225624 
Bank Name: Green Dot Bank 
Deposit Amount: Provide this amount to your employer or payroll provider. 
Account Type: Checking 

If you provided your employer’s email address, we also emailed them your direct deposit enrollment information. Make sure you follow up with your employer to check the progress of your enrollment request. Green Dot does not have your enrollment status information. If you need additional help setting up direct deposit, please call (866)-795-7974.

How it works: Many times, your employer or benefits provider will notify our bank of your incoming deposit in advance of your actual pay day. If they do, we will credit your pay or benefits to your card when they give us that advance notice instead of waiting for pay day. This way, you can have access to your money sooner!
